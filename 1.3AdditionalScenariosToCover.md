### 1.3 **Additional test Scenarios**
- I choose the following scenarios to prioritize testing effort based on the most critical part of the application  - focusing on the areas that are more likely to fail and to have the highest impact on the users and on business.
- These scenarios would ensure to capture the core functionality of the application is covered by regression testing.

- ## Tests to consider on Risk-based Prioritization
-  **High** users can Login (without logging cannot view / complete checkout ) -
   **High** -Add Items to the cart - (financial loss - no purchases )  -
   **High** -HappyPath of the checkout journey (allows to make purchases )
   **High** -Cannot bypass mandatory details on the checkout journey -
   **High** -correct price match the cart and checkout -
-  **High** -Cart caching - should not view cart details of another user - cart should remove caching when logged in as new user
   **Medium** -Can Remove / add products from the checkout -
   **Medium** -Main buttons to navigate on the page working as expected  -
-  **Medium** -Consistency design of all users - i.e. cart icon - completing your details section
   **Medium** -Redirect or successful confirmation messages  -
   **Low** -UI Design for improvements -
   **Low** -footer link - -

1.3 Additional Test Scenarios 
## Further coverage of Login page functionality would be:  
- Login functionality -add additional scenarios such as: 
    - login/logout/
      - invalid scenarios /
        - attempts to Login with valid credentials 
          - login session timeout
            - disallowed special characters
              - minimum requirements for username / password
              -    User friendly errors displayed

See login.feature for full list of scenarios to consider. 

## Further coverage of Products page functionality would be:
- Verify the maximum items can be shown on the page
    - verify each item has the correct label/attributes 
      - the correct cart badge (count) is shown on the cart
         - validate the total amount for multiple products
           - Sort By A-Z Z-A & by the price 
             -  Selecting a product by image / name
               - View / add Products without logging in 
               - check the page Title 
                 -    User friendly errors displayed
                   - UI Design -making sure consistency design for all users
                      -  Accessibility testing to consider for layout issue - (hoovering over cart icon does not show pointing icon)
                        - Accessibility testing - using keyboard - shortcuts

## Further coverage of Checkout page functionality would be - Page 1 customer details :
- Add single and multiple items to the cart and ensure the quantity and prices reflect accordingly 
    - Add - Remove items before the checkout is completed
        -    the cart quantity matches the cart total 
            -   Navigate back to products page to view other items
            -   Validation on entering mandatory details of the customer
            -   Cannot continue without mandatory details / can Cancel journey
            -   User friendly errors displayed       

## Further coverage of Checkout page functionality would be - Page 2 overview- 
- Product details displayed correctly - use as payment / shopping info - 
     - Correct costs displayed inc VAT
       - Can cancel journey
         -Link on product - takes to the product details page
             - Cannot bypass check step 1 by accessing the url directly
                - Caching of the session before the journey is completed
  - ## Further coverage of Checkout page functionality would be - Page 3 Complete -
    - Confirmation of the order is shown
      - the cart badge shows no existing items
        - can navigate back to products page


- ## Non-functionality scenarios to consider
- Test the login page of handling concurrent users (all different users)- response time
  - Simulate cart and checkout journey - check page load time 
   - Simulate cart and checkout journey -check response time of adding removing items
    - Concurrent users completing the checkout journey (already aware of performance_glitch_user, how would it impact to x 100 users)
      - Cart session
        - Image/ content rending on the pages
          - Stress testing - max number of concurrent users the site can handle
            - Measure CPU /  memory usage
              - Check log file of the application for troubleshooting 
                - DB connection - rending details
                - Security - preventing bypassing checkout process directly
                  - Accessibility WCAG shortcuts - voice control - zoomText 2.2- items - buttons - fields probably labelled
                    - API calling of Login - Products - cart - checkout 
                    - API logs and other session details are captured in the log such as successful orders
                     - Number of orders places / monitor number of visitors on the site
                       - Handle error failures in the backend 
                       -  Handle retry calls - events -  stop of services 
                         - Masking sensitive customer data in db or log files - such as passwords - bank details future cases
                         -  Loading products to the site - PRAP - migration -
                           - Mobile friendly - compatibility on different browsers

### Improvements to the existing framework
- **Improve framework** If I had more time I would enhance the scalability, maintainability and coverage of the scenarios by including non-functional areas and performance of tests by ensuring full confidence in the regression pack:
- **Jenkins** I would integrate the execution in CI/CD pipelines that would allow us to build confidence in your testing coverage
- **parallel-Testing** Across multiple browsers - firefox, chrome - safari
- **Reporting** Introduce reporting - make it accessible for BA and team members to view the results - alert emails - JUnit reporting - html format - add screenshot to failed scenarios
- **Accessibility Testing** -Add accessibility testing to run alongside UI tests
- **Performance Testing** - Include performance testing to daily monitor the statistics of the site
- **API Testing** - I would perform API testing of the user authentication - placing orders - such as retrieving GetPrice - GetStock - GetPostCode - Business logics
- **Run by Tags** - I would prioritise the tickets based on Tags @Smoke @Regression for faster feedback
- **Reduce duplicate tests / methods**  - I would reduce the duplicate of methods and add a CAS page (Common application system) for all common methods and possibility share the same tests with other departments
- **Data Management** - Move hard-coded data to config file such as username / passwords / urls
- **Multiple env** Allocate specific tests for each environment 


### **Challenges faced in the development of this practice**
**Webdriver** sharing across pages - troubleshooting as I added additional pages to make sre the same driver across all page objects
**Flaky Tests** - when logged in Chrome prompted that password has been updated and manually had to stop the debug to let the test run 
**Feature files** Adding standard practice on feature files making sure the scenarios are easily remembered and not duplicated
**Problem user** could not enter username on your information page
**Locators** standard-names labelled on locators, i.e. to remove from cart the remove button is labelled to each product

### **Challenges face in real-life scenarios**
**UI** - frequent UI changes and named improbably locators - 
**Flaky Tests** - WaitMethods sometimes can lead too slow test execution - thread.sleep and other wait methods
**Slow Test Execution** - Would benefit in real-life to have parallel execution - across multiple environment 
**Test Data** - I used hardcoded tests data on some scenarios and with the introduction of the API - user authentication - delete - create order it would increase feedback
**CI/CD** - Maintain tests in Jenkins - fix the builds due to dependencies / version conflicts - 
**Standardized tests** - Implement standard procedure across the team and review code before commits
**Maintenance** - Ensure the existing tests are maintained and updated / removed as of when required
**UI** - changes not communicated to the team.
**Team** Involve everyone to write BB feature scenarios
